# Contributing

Use Node.js 20.19+ and Python 3.10+ on macOS or Linux.

```sh
npm ci
npm run verify
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

Tests use `tests/fixtures/library` and disposable workspaces, not a contributor's
personal library. CLI fixtures cover both provider protocols without credentials
or paid model calls. For manual provider testing, create a separate workspace.

Keep graph schema validation, revision checks, evidence, and explicit review of
agent changes intact. Add behavior tests for new contracts and failure recovery.
Check desktop and narrow-screen UI when changing layouts. Never commit private
notes, source PDFs, agent output, account configuration, or personal queue state.
See `docs/RESEARCH_DESIGN.md` and `docs/OPEN_SOURCE.md` for design and packaging.
